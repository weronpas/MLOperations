    "# ✏️ Exercises: Exploring Other Datasets (scikit-learn)\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend your practice beyond the Iris dataset, try applying the **same EDA workflow** to other datasets available in `scikit-learn`.  \n",
    "This will help you generalize the process of **loading data, checking quality, visualizing distributions, detecting correlations, and generating hypotheses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Suggested Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Wine Dataset** (`load_wine`)  \n",
    "   - Classification dataset with 178 samples and 13 features describing chemical properties of wines.  \n",
    "   - Task: Explore how the three wine classes differ in terms of alcohol content, phenols, and color intensity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Breast Cancer Dataset** (`load_breast_cancer`)  \n",
    "   - Classification dataset with 569 samples and 30 features related to cell nuclei characteristics.  \n",
    "   - Task: Investigate which features appear most discriminative between malignant and benign tumors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Digits Dataset** (`load_digits`)  \n",
    "   - Classification dataset with 1,797 samples of 8x8 images of handwritten digits.  \n",
    "   - Task: Perform basic EDA to visualize digit distributions and pixel intensity correlations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Exercise Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "For each dataset:  \n",
    "1. **Load** the dataset using `from sklearn.datasets import load_<dataset_name>`  \n",
    "2. Convert it into a **pandas DataFrame** for easier handling.  \n",
    "3. Perform:  \n",
    "   - Missing value check  \n",
    "   - Descriptive statistics  \n",
    "   - Distribution plots (histograms, boxplots)  \n",
    "   - Correlation heatmaps  \n",
    "   - Pairplots (if feasible)  \n",
    "4. **Compare classes** and propose **hypotheses** about feature importance and separability.  \n",

    "## 📘 Example Starter Code\n",

    "# Load dataset\n",
